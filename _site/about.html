<h2 id="june-30-2001---september-24-2011">June 30, 2001 - September 24, 2011</h2>

<p>Nathan’s life ended way too soon. He was a precious gift from above. He was loved dearly by his family and friends. He has such a tender heart and was always smiling. Nathan loved his family, friends and most importantly God. His favorite saying was “I love you all the way from the ground up to God.” We can not put into words the pain we have and will continue to have. We have learned to go on living through our pain by using the Nathan Hayes Fund to help others. We know that is what Nathan would want.</p>

<p>Thank you for all you have done and continue to do to help in our quest to never forget and honor our son the best way we know how.</p>
